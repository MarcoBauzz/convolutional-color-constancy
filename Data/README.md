Experiments are performed on the ColorChecker dataset [Gehler et al. 2008] using the original threefold cross-validation split, but the “recommended” images and ground truth data by Hemrit et al. [2020].

The ground truth with fold information is available from this repository in file `./Data/GT_HemritRec.txt`.\
The “recommended” images and polygonal mask information by Hemrit et al. [2020] may be downloaded at this url: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tKrL3pMV1tdAEtmeWGKlHoUU6UfpUSKZ. \

For our experimentation, we masked all images, rescaled all images to have the maximum side be 800 pixels long, rotated automatically vertical images, and rotated manually the following images:\
